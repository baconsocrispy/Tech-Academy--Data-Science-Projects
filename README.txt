DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS

Uniform Distribution - All events are equiprobable (Coin Toss/Card Dealt/Die Rolled)

Bernoulli Distribution - Events have binary outcome (True/False, 1/0)

Binomial Distribution - Binary outcome per iteration, many iterations

Poisson Distribution - Events / Time Interval


CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS

Normal Distribution - Symmetric distribution / Bell Curve

Student's T Distribution - 
A small sample approximation of normal distribution. 
(Accomodates extreme values significantly better)

Chi-Square Test - 
Asymmetric, Only consists of positive values. 
Typically does not mirror reality. Used for Hypothesis testing 
and goodness of fit.

Exponential Distribution - Time Intervals Between Events

Logistic Distribution - Likelihood of extreme events occuring

Bimodal Distribution - Distribution with 2 modes (Median/Mean fall in between)


FORMULAS

Probability Density Function

Variance: variance is the measure of dispersion in a data set. It 
measures how spread out a data set is. It is the average squared 
deviation of values from the mean. It is used to find the standard 
deviation that is represented by the Greek letter sigma in it’s 
lowercase form

Standard Deviation

Sample Deviation

Central Tendency - Where does center of data tend to be most (measured by
mean, median mode)

Z Score - Measures exactly how many standard deviations above or below
the mean a data point is
mu = mean | sigma = standard deviation
z = (x - mu) / sigma
The score is then looked up in the z-score positive or negative table
to get percentile

R value - range from -1 to +1 Determines the strength of how 
variables are related. The closer to zero, the less correlated they are.

Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (same as r): Measures correlation between two 
continuous variables x and y. The value will fall between -1 and 1. If the value is 1 or near 1 it is said to be perfect
correlation. Negative correlation is not necessarily bad. .5-1 is strong correlation.
Moderate correlation between .3 and .5. .3 and less is low correlation. 0 = no correlation.

*Simple Linear Regression: Regression with only one independent variable,
used to predict a dependent variable. Need to remove outliers for more 
accurate predictions.
b = r * Sy/Sx
Slope = Correlation Coefficient * Stand. Dev. y / Stand. Dev. x
function: y = mx + b

*Least Squares Regression Line: Calculation to make the variance of data from
the regression line as small as possible. 

DEFINITIONS

Descriptive Statistics - Help explain larger body of information (Mean, 
Median, Mode, GPA, etc.)

Inferential Statistics - Making conclusions about overall population from 
sample data

Coefficient is the number used to multiply a variable.

Response variable: variable outcome that is being considered in a study.

Explanatory variable: variable used to describe the reasons for the response outcomes.

B0 (Beta-naught) / B1 (beta-one): standardized regression coefficients. Estimates
resulting from regression analysis - measure how strong predictor (independent) variable
in linear regression influences dependent variable. Measured in units of standard deviation.
Beta-naught denotes y-intercept and b1 denotes slope of the line.

Epsilon: error term or random error component. Describes how a predicted value for y,
the dependent variable, may actually vary from the predicted regression line. Difference
between observed and expected.

Hat Operator (^): Placed over variables to denote that they are predicted or estimated.

Residual: measure of how well a data point matches its predicted value. Measure the
distance of a data point to the line on the graph

RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error - the standard deviation of the residuals. Smaller 
the RMSE the closer the observations are to predicted values. 1. Square the residuals,
2. find the average of the residuals. 3. Get the square root of that total. 

SYMBOLS

Mean - X-Bar, an x with a bar over it. Any variable with a bar
over it can represent a mean, when more than 1 mean is in an equation. 


P - probability

p̂ - p-hat
x̄ - x-bar - sample mean of x
Xi - collection of x-coordinates
ȳ - y-bar - sample mean of y
Yi - collection of x-coordinates

Δ - uppercase delta - change
δ - lowercase delta 
ε - epsilon - error term / random error component
μ - Mu - population mean
Σ - uppercase sigma - sum of collection
s - lowercase s - standard deviation of sample
σ - lowercase sigma - standard deviation of population
